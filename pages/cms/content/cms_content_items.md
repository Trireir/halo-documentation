## What is a Content Item?

A Content Item is one of each elements that can be consumed from an application and that defines the behavior of this application.
Content Items must match with the structure of a module (for more information about modules [click here](./cms_content_modules.html))
and its fields contain the information that will be consumed.

Content Items can be created, deleted, published and saved as concept. Here we are describing how to operate over this content
items to change their states. The description of the states are:

1. **Created**: You can create a Content Item by filling the title for this item. This is the only mandatory information, since
all the fields are optional.
2. **Deleted**: Every element deleted in the CMS has a logic deletion, so the information can be retrieved by an administrator
if it would be possible.
3. **Saved as concept**: Once you create an item it will not be published by default. This item will be saved as concept unless you click on
'*publish*'. Saved as concept items can be changed and scheduled for publication, but they are not actually published.
4. **Published**: Those are the considered visible items for the apps.

{% include important.html content="This operation only searches in the content items by title name. It does not use any of the contents stored inside the item." %}

### Schedule for publication and expiration

To schedule a **publication**:

- Enter the content item you want to schedule.
- On the '*Parameters*' panel, fill the '*Publish on*' calendars.

- Click on '<span class="fa fa-upload" /> *Publish*'.
- This content will be expired at the scheduled date and time.

### Schedule notification

When publishing content, you can schedule this publication with a Push notification. This means that when the item is published, a new
push notification will be sent to all the devices targetted by the segmentation tags. To perform this sort of publication:

- Create a new Content Item or access one already created.
- Fill in all the fields and the title for the item.
- '*Parameters*' panel, click on '*Add push notification*'.
- In the form that appears, select a template already configured in the Module Structure.
- Fill in the app, the publication date and time and the tags.
- Fill in the template information that reflects the notification that will be displayed in the apps.
- On the top action bar click on '<span class="fa fa-upload"/> *Publish*' button.
